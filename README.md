# HazamaKuroo

This gem is to play Blackjack with a very simple rule.

## HazamaKuroo's rule as Blackjack
1. Players are the CPU and you.
2. First, it will deal two cards to each of the CPU (displayed as 'HZM') and you.
   - One of the CPU's cards is the Hole Card.
3. You can get additional cards, but be careful that the total of your cards value does not exceed 21.
   - If your total exceeds 21, you will lose immediately.
   - If you will get 'A', you can select 1 or 11.
   - 'J', 'Q', or 'K' are worth 10.
4. If you will hit, Hole Card is opened.
   - The CPU will continue to draw until at least 17.
5. The winner is the one who has the largest card total value.
